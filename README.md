# Universal-Internet-Adapter-Code
Create the code with SPI Controller syntax to the UIA device for debugging.
How to enable firewall SPI Controller to the Universal Internet Adapter.
Concept to enable full-proof Internet Security to compile the UIA with SPI.
Once the coding is logical to it's infancy to bottleneck between node A and node B.
The nodes between A and B, has a filter to prevent no intrusion within the Internet Signal.
In order for the UIA to work, the SPI, or Serial Peripheral Interface Controller is embedded,
In the device for the UIA, a product, called "CONNEXX", this device can elude the hacking of a node.
The theory of this device, is based on a class instructor teaching my classmates,
States, since 1946, United States Defense Department created DARPA, and the NAVY created the beginnings of the Web;
The entire web was deliberate and manipulated between the (NIC) Network Interface Controller and the Web itself;
to hold backdoors to debug and edit the Web. Than as the NAVY spread the Transatlantic Cables for the Internet to spread worldwide,
it open the door for military bases to have a communications worldwide. In the late sixties and seventies, the Internet a was test bed,
to have Universities with grants to improve the Internet. Once the Internet exploded, it began to go public, and commercialize it. 
What today we have, those existing backdoors are present, which still leaves exploitation of hackers to hack private and business sectors.
I have the idea and theory, though the Internet cannot be undone, it can have a filter, to prevent such intrusions, and eliminate all
other forms internet piracy. I can only write the concept, it needs a coding to be embedded to a product the size of Google Chrome Cast,
called "CONNEXX". It be true firewall with SPI Controller to handle the bottleneck of handshaking with the data packets filtering within
the (UIA) Universal Internet Adapter. < I D T E C U > would be a possible company, Intelligent Digital Technologies United to develop this
device which could be the first lind of defense in Internet Security.
